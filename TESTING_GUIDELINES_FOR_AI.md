# SentryHub Testing Guidelines for AI Assistant

This document outlines the process and guidelines for incrementally adding tests to the SentryHub Django project using an AI assistant.

**Core Principles:**

1.  **Incremental Approach:** Add tests piece by piece, focusing on one component (model, form, view, service, etc.) at a time.
2.  **Verification:** After generating tests for a component, run them locally to ensure they pass.
3.  **Tracking:** Update the `TEST_COVERAGE_TRACKING.md` file after tests for a component are successfully written and pass.
4.  **Isolation:** Aim for unit tests where possible, mocking dependencies. Use integration tests when testing interactions between components.
5.  **Clarity:** Test names should clearly describe what they are testing. Assertions should be specific.
6.  **No `codeBase.json` Modification:** **Crucially, do not read from or modify the `codeBase.json` file.** Analyze the actual Python/JS/HTML code directly.

**Testing Stack:**

*   **Backend (Python/Django):**
    *   Framework: `unittest` (Python built-in) and `django.test.TestCase`.
    *   Tools: `django.test.Client`, `django.test.RequestFactory`, `django.utils.timezone`, `datetime.timedelta`.
    *   Mocking: `unittest.mock` (standard library).
    *   Fixtures/Factories: Initially manual object creation. Consider `factory-boy` later if needed.
*   **Frontend (JavaScript):**
    *   Framework: Jest (or Vitest, specify if preferred).
    *   Utilities: Testing Library (for DOM interaction testing).
    *   Mocking: Jest's built-in mocking capabilities (e.g., `jest.fn()`, `jest.mock()`).

**Workflow for Each Component:**

1.  **Identify Target:** Choose the next component to test from the `TEST_COVERAGE_TRACKING.md` file (usually one marked with ‚ö™Ô∏è).
2.  **Generate Prompt:** Use the specific prompt template provided below, filling in the details for the target component.
3.  **Provide Context:** Ensure the AI has access to the relevant project code files.
4.  **Generate Tests:** Ask the AI to generate the test code based on the prompt.
5.  **Integrate Code:** Place the generated code into the appropriate `tests.py` (or `test_*.py` / `*.test.js`) file. Handle imports and potential conflicts if appending to existing files.
6.  **Run Tests:** Execute the specific tests for the component locally (e.g., `python manage.py test app_name.tests.TestClassName`).
7.  **Debug/Refine:** If tests fail, provide the error messages back to the AI and ask for corrections. Iterate until all tests for the component pass.
8.  **Update Tracking:** Once tests pass, update the status of the corresponding component in `TEST_COVERAGE_TRACKING.md` to üü¢ Done and add any relevant notes.
9.  **Commit Changes:** Commit the new/updated test file and the updated tracking file.

## Prompt Template for AI

```text
**Previous Context:**
We are incrementally adding tests to the SentryHub Django project using the guidelines in `TESTING_GUIDELINES_FOR_AI.md`. We previously tested [Mention last successfully tested component, e.g., "the SilenceRule model"].

**Current Goal:**
Write tests for the **[Specify Component Type, e.g., Form, View, Service]** named **`[Component Name, e.g., SilenceRuleForm]`** located in **`[File Path, e.g., alerts/forms.py]`**.

**Context Files:**
Analyze the code in the following file(s) to understand the component's functionality:
*   `[File Path for the component, e.g., alerts/forms.py]`
*   [If relevant, add paths to related models, e.g., `alerts/models.py`]
*   [If relevant, add paths to related views or services]

**Testing Framework:** [Specify: `unittest` and `django.test.TestCase` OR `Jest` and `Testing Library`]

**Task:**
1.  Identify the key functionalities and potential edge cases of the `[Component Name]` based on its code.
2.  Write [Specify: `unit` or `integration`] tests covering the following scenarios:
    *   [Scenario 1: e.g., Test form validation with valid data.]
    *   [Scenario 2: e.g., Test form validation with invalid data (specify invalid cases, like end_date before start_date).]
    *   [Scenario 3: e.g., Test the `clean_matchers` method specifically.]
    *   [Scenario 4: e.g., Test if `form.save()` correctly creates/updates the database object.]
    *   [Scenario 5: e.g., For Views: Test GET request returns 200 and uses correct template.]
    *   [Scenario 6: e.g., For Views: Test POST request with valid data redirects/returns correct response.]
    *   [Scenario 7: e.g., For Views: Test access control/permissions.]
    *   [Scenario 8: e.g., For JS: Test function `xyz` returns expected output for inputs A and B.]
    *   [Scenario 9: e.g., For JS: Test clicking button `abc` triggers expected DOM change or API call (mock fetch).]
    *   *(Add/remove scenarios as needed based on the component)*
3.  [If Backend] Use `django.test.Client` or `RequestFactory` for view/API tests. Create necessary test data (e.g., Users, related model instances) within tests or `setUp` methods.
4.  [If Backend] Use `unittest.mock.patch` if dependencies need to be mocked for unit testing.
5.  [If Frontend] Use Testing Library utilities (`render`, `screen`, `fireEvent`) for interaction tests. Mock `fetch` or other external dependencies using `jest.mock`.
6.  Place the generated test code into the appropriate file: **`[Target Test File Path, e.g., alerts/tests.py or static/alerts/js/__tests__/comments.test.js]`**. Append to the file if it already contains tests, ensuring imports are handled correctly.

**Output:**
Provide the *complete code* for the specified test file (`[Target Test File Path]`).

**Reminder:**
*   Follow the testing stack defined in the guidelines.
*   Ensure tests are independent.
*   use this python C:\codes\python_codes\prometheus_alerts\venv\Scripts\python to run tests
